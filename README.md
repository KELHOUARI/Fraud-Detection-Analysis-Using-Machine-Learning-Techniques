# Fraud-Detection-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Project Overview
This project aims to address the critical challenge of fraud detection in financial transactions. Utilizing a synthetic financial dataset, the focus is on applying various machine learning techniques to identify and predict fraudulent activities. The dataset, generated by the PaySim mobile money simulator, mimics real-world financial transactions while embedding simulated fraudulent patterns for analysis.

Key Objectives
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Investigate the dataset's characteristics, including cleaning, normalization, and feature selection, to prepare it for machine learning models.
Model Comparison and Evaluation: Implement and evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and Random Forests. The goal is to compare these models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in detecting fraudulent transactions.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilize techniques like GridSearchCV for optimizing model parameters, ensuring the best possible performance in fraud detection.
Model Interpretation and Validation: Interpret the models' results and validate their performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and the F1-score.
Tools and Technologies
Python: Primary programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
Plotly and Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: As the development environment for interactive coding and documentation.
Outcomes
